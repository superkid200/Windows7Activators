## What should I consider before running it?
1) If you like Windows, I would recommend you buying it directly from Microsoft (this is for educational purposes only)
2) Be sure you know what you're doing. Don't do anything if you don't understand what each functionality does. We are not responsible for any damages done to your computer. We recommned you to create a restore point first.
